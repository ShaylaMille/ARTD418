                <h2>The assignment detailed creating an experiment on kinetic branding systems. I was able to use creative branding systems, along with kinetic imagery to create an animated Bragg logo and vegetable icons for the already existing company. The applications utilized were Adobe After Effects, Html, CSS, and Java Scripts. 
                
                <p>Upon receiving the assignment, I was worrisome. I had never explored Adobe After Effects, nor the coding platforms. I caught onto After Effects quicker than expected. The application and the multitude of creations is limitless. On the other hand, coding did not come with ease. After much trial and error, I have found some sort of knowledge for the platforms. Exploring new applications was very primal at the current moment. As a soon-to-be graduating senior, I can say I will be leaving with a new multitude of skills.</p>

                <span class="text-left"> After I started using the Bragg Liquid Aminos, I got the chance to redesign the packaging in a course at the University of Illinois.The original packaging was very chaotic with bright colors of red and yellow. I wanted to create a minimalistic design with a sleek undertone color. The finished design included outlined vegetables in a subtle green with a light tan background. I used a thin font and condensed the nutritional back of the label. The project has since been building and cannot be happier.
